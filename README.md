== Installation of custom puzzles ==

Place the .lua files in your TIS-100 custom puzzles folder (on Windows usually found at
C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\TIS-100\1234567890\custom\). They should then automatically
appear in the 'Specification Editor' screen inside TIS-100.

If you're unable to locate this folder you can also find it by selecting 'Create new specification'
in the 'Specification Editor' screen (inside TIS-100), and then selecting 'Edit specification'. An
Explorer screen (if on Windows) should open in the correct folder.
